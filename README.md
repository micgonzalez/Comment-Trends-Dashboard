# Comment-Trends-Dashboard
This dashboard is like one which included visual charts that conveyed weekly comments from Guests. The original dashboard was one of my projects that was featured in my Data Analyst job at The Disneyland Resort. The dashboard informed resort management from Attractions to Retail of any upcoming trends.


# Introduction
This repository displays a dashboard that is like what I created in my day job as a Data Analyst for The Disneyland Resort. The data set used for this repository is public data of Tripadvisor’s reviews for The Disneyland Resort. The reason is I’m not able to use the actual excel file due to its sensitive nature.


# Abstract
When Disneyland’s theme park general managers want a visual representation that will display an overview of their area. This dashboard allows you to select by land and venue which will reflect on four charts that focus on Cast Member interactions, trends by location, trending topics by location, and trending topics. The dashboard gives theme park general managers an overview of trends from Guest’s comments.


# Summary of Skills
This dashboard has been made with Microsoft Excel for the creation of pivot tables and charts.

There are four main trends based on the overall sentiment of the comments. Looking at Locations trends chart displays a balanced distribution of positive and negative comments for Disneyland. Looking at trending topics chart shows majority of Guest’s comment said they had a wonderful time at the theme parks. 


# Challenges
The challenge for this dashboard was to find a public data set that would have trends that would be like Disney’s proprietary data set.


# Conclusion
This dashboard is made with the purpose of informing theme park managers of Guest’s comments from their visit to the theme parks. This dashboard will give theme park managers a high-level visual summary. It also conveys the sentiment based on trends and interaction with Cast Members.
